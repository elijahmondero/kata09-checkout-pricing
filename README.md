# üõí Checkout Pricing Kata

Welcome to the **Checkout Pricing Kata**! This project is designed to solve a common problem in e-commerce platforms: calculating the total price of items in a shopping cart, including handling special offers and discounts.

## üìñ The Kata

The task is to develop a system that can calculate the total price for a list of scanned items, considering various pricing rules, including unit prices and special offers like "3 for the price of 2" or "Buy one get one free".

## üõ†Ô∏è The Solution

This project is structured with two main components:

1. **CheckoutPricing.Api** (`CheckoutPricing.Api.csproj`)  
   A .NET 8 Web API that manages the checkout process. It handles the following endpoints:
   - `POST /checkout/pricingrules` to set the pricing rules.
   - `POST /checkout/scan/{item}` to scan an item.
   - `GET /checkout/total` to calculate and return the total price based on the scanned items.

2. **CheckoutPricing.Api.Tests** (`CheckoutPricing.Api.Tests.csproj`)  
   A .NET 8 SpecFlow test project using xUnit. It leverages `TestServer` to perform integration testing against the API. The tests are written in Gherkin syntax and ensure the correctness of the checkout logic.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- .NET 8 SDK
- Visual Studio or your preferred C# IDE

### Running the API

1. Navigate to the `CheckoutPricing.Api` project.
2. Run the API using your IDE or the command line:

```bash
dotnet run --project CheckoutPricing.Api.csproj
```

### Running the Tests
Navigate to the CheckoutPricing.Api.Tests project.
Execute the tests using the following command:

```bash
Copy code
dotnet test
```

This will run the SpecFlow tests, which will interact with the API through TestServer to validate the checkout functionality.

Running the API with Docker

1. Build the Docker image:

```bash
docker build -t kata09-checkout-pricing .
```

2. Run the Docker container:

```bash
docker run -d -p 5062:8080 --name checkout-pricing kata09-checkout-pricing
```

This will build and run the API in a Docker container, exposing it on port 80.

## üéØ Features
- Simple Pricing Rules: Set unit prices for each item.
- Special Offers: Handle special offers like bulk discounts.
- Integration Testing: SpecFlow tests that validate the API's behavior through realistic scenarios.
